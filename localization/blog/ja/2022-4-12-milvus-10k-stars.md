<p>We recently hit an incredible milestone in the journey of vector database - over 10K stars on the <a href="https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus">GitHub repo of Milvus</a>. Thanks to each and every one of you who has supported us by giving us a star ⭐️.</p>
<p>It has been a wonderful 2.5 years since Milvus became an open-source project. When we first started, very few people understood exactly what a vector database is, let alone talking about how it would enable and accelerate AI adoption in our daily lives. Milvus vector database carries our vision of defining and building the next-generation database for AI. We combine SOTA algorithms with cloud technologies in the Milvus project so developers could build AI applications at ease with Milvus vector database.</p>
