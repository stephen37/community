<p><a href="https://milvus.io/">Milvus</a> is an open-source vector database. It supports adding, deleting, updating, and near real-time search of massive vector datasets created by extracting feature vectors from unstructured data using AI models. With a comprehensive set of intuitive APIs, and support for multiple widely adopted index libraries (e.g., Faiss, NMSLIB, and Annoy), Milvus accelerates machine learning application development and machine learning operations (MLOps). With Milvus, you can rapidly develop a minimum viable product (MVP) while keeping costs at lower limits.</p>
<p>&quot;What resources are available for developing an AI application with Milvus?‚Äù is commonly asked in the Milvus community. Zilliz, the <a href="https://zilliz.com/">company</a> behind Milvus, developed a number of demos that leverage Milvus to conduct lightening-fast similarity search that powers intelligent applications. Source code of Milvus solutions can be found at <a href="https://github.com/zilliz-bootcamp">zilliz-bootcamp</a>. The following interactive scenarios demonstrate natural language processing (NLP), reverse image search, audio search, and computer vision.</p>
